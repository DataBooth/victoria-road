### Submission to the Portfolio Committee No. 6 â€“ Transport and the Arts

#### Re: Inquiry into the impact of the Rozelle Interchange

Dear Members of the Portfolio Committee No. 6,

I am writing to express the concerns of me and my family who have lived in Drummoyne (East) for over 22 years, and also what I understand to be commonly shared concerns of the Drummoyne community regarding the Rozelle Interchange that commenced operations in November 2023. The introduction of this infrastructure has significantly altered traffic patterns, leading to increased volumes and congestion that have adversely affected the daily lives of local residents.

**Increased Traffic Volumes and Congestion**

Since the opening of the Rozelle Interchange, there has been a noticeable increase in traffic through Drummoyne, particularly during peak hours. The surge in vehicles, including those not local to the area, has resulted in extended travel times and has disrupted the flow of traffic on main thoroughfares and residential streets alike.

**Speeding in Residential Areas**

The redirection of traffic has also led to an increase in vehicles using back streets to bypass congestion. This has raised safety concerns due to excessive speeds, putting residents, especially children and the elderly, at risk.

**Impact on Pedestrians**

Pedestrians have been significantly impacted, with increased queuing at intersections and delays caused by changes to traffic light sequences. These alterations have made it challenging for pedestrians to navigate crossings safely and efficiently, particularly during rush hours.

**Increased Pollution**

It is very clear to us that the increased volume of traffic using the city bound lanes in Drummoyne north-west of Lyons Road as a virtual "car park" has significantly increased pollution residue in the front and back yards of our property in Wrights Road.

**Community Feedback**

Feedback from the Drummoyne community indicates a strong sentiment that the interchange has brought more harm than benefit to the area. Residents have reported feeling less safe and more inconvenienced since its implementation.

**Recommendations**

In light of these issues, I urge the committee to consider the following recommendations (and indicative timelines):

| Reference # | Issue                                         | Potential Solution                                                                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                | Increased Traffic Volumes and Congestion      | Initiate a detailed traffic impact study by June 2024, focusing on identifying peak traffic times, the primary sources of congestion, and proposing specific infrastructural or regulatory changes to alleviate congestion. I note that currently there have not been counters install on the east-side of Lyons Road (and Victoria Road) which makes it difficult to understand the impacts on these changes to East Drummoyne. |
| 2                | Speeding in Residential Areas                 | Implement comprehensive traffic calming measures by September 2024, including increased signage, social media and similar advertising campaigns and enhanced enforcement of speed limits through regular police patrols. |
| 3                | Impact on Pedestrians                         | Conduct a review of traffic light sequences and pedestrian crossing times at key intersections by June 2024, with adjustments to be implemented by August 2024 to ensure safer and more efficient pedestrian movement. In particular, the intersection of Lyons Road and Victoria Road is increasingly dangerous to cross given increased queuing behaviours and frustration levels of motorists. |
| 4                | Inefficient Traffic Management                | Deploy advanced traffic management systems using near real-time data analytics to dynamically adjust traffic light sequences and lane configurations, particularly on Victoria Road, to optimise traffic flow. |
| 5                | Additional northbound traffic on Victoria Road | Re-evaluate and redesign lane allocations on Victoria Road to include additional northbound capacity during morning peak hours by September 2024, ensuring a smoother flow of traffic and reduced congestion and motorist frustration. |
| 6                | Inefficient bus lane on Victoria Road (Gladesville Bridge) southbound | Assess the current usage and efficiency of the bus lane on Victoria Road southbound by April 2024, with proposals for optimisation or repurposing to be developed by September 2024. Local residents have significantly increased travel times (from Gladesville and Hunters Hill) because of unnecessary blockages caused by the long-duration weekday bus lane. |
| 7                | Failed or inaccurate traffic modelling        | Commission a targeted independent review of the existing traffic modelling practices and assumptions used by Transport for NSW by July 2024, with recommendations for improvements and updates to be implemented by December 2024. |
| 8                | Community Feedback                            | Establish a transparent, ongoing community consultation process using online platforms to gather feedback and engage with residents on traffic management and infrastructure planning with clear reporting of trends and communication of changes/enhancements.  |

We look forward to the committee's prompt actions to review submissions and to formulate meaningful responses to improve the quality of life of both Drummoyne residents and residents of other impacted suburbs.

Sincerely,  
Michael Booth
